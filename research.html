<p>
Record linkage (deduplication or entity resolution) is the process of merging together noisy databases and removing duplicate entities, often in the absence of a unique identifier. Linking data from multiple databases can increase the utility of many datasets and performing this linkage procedure using Bayesian methods can greatly enhance the analysis that results through the opportunity for error propagation. My work has broadly focused on improving computational efficiency of fitting Bayesian entity resolution models and ensuring proper inference on linked data can be achieved. Applications include official statistics, ecology, and social sciences.

<h1>MCMC for Resampling with Complex Dependency</h1>

<p>For data with complex dependency (including spatial, graph, network, and other data structures), conditionally specified models can be formulated on the basis of an underlying Markov random field. This approach often provides an attractive alternative to direct specification of a full joint data distribution, which may be difficult for large, correlated data structures. For such Markov random field models, I have developed a new and fast way to simulate data, which has provable convergence rate properties, such as geometric ergodicity. This method has been used to allow for hypothesis testing with statistics with no known asymptotic distribution, such as those for assessing goodness-of-fit. </p>

<h1>Instability and Degeneracy of Deep Learning</h1>

<p>A restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is an undirected graphical model used for image classification, and in recent years, has risen to prominence due to their connection to deep learning. A RBM is characterized by having two layers, one hidden and one visible, and is described as a generative model. By incorporating a hidden layer, RBMs are thought to have the ability to encode very complex and rich structures in data, making them attractive for supervised learning. However, the statistical properties of this model for conceptualizing data are largely unexplored in the literature, and the commonly cited fitting methodology remains heuristic-based and abstruse. I provide steps toward a thorough understanding of the model and its behavior from the perspective
of statistical theory and then explore the possibility of a rigorous fitting methodology via MCMC.</p>

<h1>Interactive and Statistical Graphics</h1>

<p>Across all my research, I place a strong value on how research is conducted and results are shared. Specifically, I am a proponent of reproducibility in research. My work is open sourced, developed in the open online community, and is often accompanied by a software package or application. By espousing these practices, I have enjoyed collaborations with other researchers in the field with the same values, and our work has greatly benefited. Much of that collaboration has happened in the field of interactive statistical graphics.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>

<p>According to John Tukey, "the best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone's backyard." I don't disagree. I love being able to work (and play) in a variety of topics. Some of this work does not fit nicely into the above topics, but was still incredibly rewarding.</p>
