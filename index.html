		<p>I am an Assistant Professor at Colorado State University in the Department of Statistics.</p>
		<p>I completed a postdoc at Duke University working with Beka Steorts after completing my Ph.D. in Statistics at Iowa State University with Dan Nordman and Steve Vardeman. I also have an M.S. in Statistics from Iowa State University with Heike Hofmann and Dan Nordman and an M.A. in Mathematics at The University of Texas at Austin under the direction of John Luecke and Martha Smith. I received my B.S. in Mathematics with a certificate in Computing from The University of Texas at Austin.

    <p>
      I'm interested in the intersection of Statistics and Computing, specifically the topics of Statistical Machine Learning, Bayesian Statistics, Computational Statistics, Record Linkage and Entity Resolution, Markov chain Monte Carlo and Spatial Resampling, Interactive Statistical Graphics, and Reproducible Research. I like struggling with JavaScript and learning new languages, R being my first love.
    </p>
		<p>I enjoy climbing rocks, riding bikes, and cooking/eating delicious food.</p>
